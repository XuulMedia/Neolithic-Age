# Neolithic-Age

## About

Inspired by TerrafirmaCraft & the Terrafirmapunk modpack. I wanted to create something that fit in better with vanilla minecraft while maintaining the accomplishment and buildup of the more hardcore early game mods. Being for a much older version of MC I also wanted to modernize things a bit and take off a bit of the jank from TFC. This aims to be a VanillaPlusPlus mod, redoing the balance and 

## Vision

The long term goals for this mod is to change the core of minecraft to add longer and more granual early game. In vanilla, the lowest level of tools are only used for a few seconds. I want to make the different tiers more meaningful. To do that I have add tool requirements for many blocks - no more punching logs. In addtition I have adjusted the mining level of MANY blocks. When I first played Minecraft back in 2010, I recall mining around a diamond node since I did not have the tools to collect it. My hope is to slow progression enough that a player will actually want to keep note of late game resources for later collection.

**Worldgen:** I do not want do any majore overhaul of the worldgen. I plan to add new ores, plants and a few other items, but want to refrain from TFC's approach of remaking the world. This project started during 1.16, but having seen the work Mojang has put into the world since then has only given me confidence that this was the correect ideas. Here is my original thoughts on worldgen for posterity: " [World Gen should be] left alone. This is a concious choice. Redoing the entire world is both a lot of work and takes the mod further from minecraft. While there will be tweaks to ore spawnrates and other things, the bones of the world will remain the same. Further I want the Nether and the End to be a part of this mod. They are big parts of the game and mods like TFC ignoring them felt like a missed opprtunity."

**Resources:** Removing block versions of many harvestables is a must. This means that the act of gathering and crafting has a seperation. While this will increase inventory clutter, I think it will help slow down the early game and force players to set up a base of operations and grow from there. Building a bridge across a large chasm should require some preperation, not just the dirt sitting beside you. Deciding what should obey gravity and what should not has been a big challenge. I honestly feel Silk Touch will be Overpowered in this version of the game. Original design docs had stone caving in like in TFC, but I found that this removed cave exploration- instead I leaned in to cave exploring by making it much more advantageous to explore natural caves.

**Automation:** Immersive engineering is my inspiration. While there are other mods like reate are iuncrediuble, Immersive Engineering is one of my favorite mods. I decided I wanted to create this mod when watching a let's play of terrafirmapunk, and seeing how janky the later game tech was implmenented. BluSunrize's advice and help was crucial during the extemely early days of development of this mod. He answered my annoying questions on Discord, and analyzing his code taught me good design patterns, even if implemented things differently.


**Food:** I want to add more variety and bonuses to eating and farming more complex recipes. 

**Hostile Mobs:** I want to add several hostile mobs, mostly in the form of predator animals. I also dislike the need to light up every crack to prevent spawning. A new type of block "Cut Stone" will exist and prevent monsters from rising.

**Passive Mobs: ** Make horses a bit more useful and incentivise keeping animals around. Slowing down breeding and reducing the efficiveness of tower style mob farms.


My favorite mods of all time:
EnerIO (the cable system was mindblowing at the time)
Forestry
Immersive Engineering
