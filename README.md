# Neolithic-Age

## About

Inspired by mods like TerrafirmaCraft, I wanted to create something that fit in better with vanilla minecraft while maintaining the accomplishment and buildup of the more hardcore early game mods. Being for a much older version of MC I also wanted to modernize things a bit and take off a bit of the edge. For this reason I aimed to leave the terrain generation alone where possible to mesh better with the game.

## Vision

The long term goals for this mod is to change the core of minecraft to add longer and more granual early game. In vanilla, the lowest level of tools are only used for a few seconds. I wanted to strecth that and make the different tiers more meaningful. Removing punching logs is the first step of this but eventually I want there to be different tool teirs past diamond level, and add more variants to existing items (harder and softer trees). Current idea is to have the following tool levels Flint(stone) > Bronze > iron > steel > Titanium > End Metal?

**Worldgen:** Left alone. This is a concious choice. Redoing the entire world is both a lot of work and takes the mod further from minecraft. While there will be tweaks to ore spawnrates and other things, the bones of the world will remain the same. Further I want the Nether and the End to be a part of this mod. They are big parts of the game and mods like TFC ignoring them felt like a missed opprtunity.

**Resources:** Most resources should require more processing before they are useable. Wood logs need to be cut to planks then assembled into a block. Stone blocks need to be stacked to make cobble ect... To offset the increase in resouces a few new methods of storage will be implemented.

**Automation:** Immersive engineering is my inspiration for this part of the mod. Machines, belts, electricity and steam. Things should require work to gather and set up early then produced in increasingly more efficient manners allowing for more creative and exttravigant builds. 

**Food:** I want to add more variety and bonuses to eating and farming more complex recipes. 

**Hostile Mobs:** I want to add several hostile mobs, mostly in the form of predator animals. I also dislike the need to light up every crack to prevent spawning. The current plan is to have a certain type of block (any cut stone at the moment) prevent mob spawning. This should allow for easier decorative builds without having to store torches on the roof.

**Passive Mobs: ** Make horses a bit more useful and incentivise keeping animals around. Slowing down breeding and reducing the efficiveness of tower style mob farms.
